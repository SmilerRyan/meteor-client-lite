<h1 align="center">Meteor Lite</h1>
<p align="center">A Minecraft Fabric Utility Mod framework.</p>

<hr>
This is **NOT** designed to be a "Ghost Client" or "hacked client" but purely just **meteor client without the meteor modules**, and **without the commands system** which make using the original considered hacking.<br>
You can still add modules via addons, but "Meteor Lite" itself **comes with no usable modules** and **expects you** to make your own addon mods if you want to use any.<br><br>
For technical users, the only changes from the original "Meteor Client" and "Meteor Lite" are:
- The removal of the chat command system (keybind, hiding prefix setting, sending chat commands)
- Moving all the default modules to the "Meteor" category
- Force disabling any toggle or search for modules in the "Meteor" category
- Rebranding the name/colors of "Meteor Client" to "Meteor Lite".
